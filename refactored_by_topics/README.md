# Fastai lessons refactored by topics

Here each lesson from the (extremely well) documented fastai lessons in this repo  
have been refactored into general topics to help when you want to focus on just
a single area of deep learning.

Recommended workflow:

watch lesson videos (multiple times)

read / workthrough main lesson notes

refer back to individual topics for a refresh
